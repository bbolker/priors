# Priors

- know your parameters
- Cromwell's rule
  - > think it possible that you may be mistaken
- Transformation to achieve bounds (after / often ( can't read this? -JCP))
- Variance parameters
  - Inverse-Gamma x
  - Parameter expanded (Cauchy / t)
  - half-t / cauchy
  - multivariate
  - param-exp wishart
  - LKJ
  - Separable correlations and stders
- prior predictive simulations
- improper vs weak vs regularizing / shrinking / neutral vs non neutral (McCarthy)
- Reparametrizations (R_0 and r) or aux priors (init conditions)
- Avoid bad tails (flatness)
- Power exponential
