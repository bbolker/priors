	abstract = {Bayesian hierarchical models typically involve specifying prior distributions for one or more variance components. This is rather removed from the observed data, so specification based on expert knowledge can be difficult. While there are suggestions for "default" priors in the literature, often a conditionally conjugate inverse-gamma specification is used, despite documented drawbacks of this choice. The authors suggest "conservative" prior distributions for variance components, which deliberately give more weight to smaller values. These are appropriate for investigators who are skeptical about the presence of variability in the second-stage parameters (random effects) and want to particularly guard against inferring more structure than is really present. The suggested priors readily adapt to various hierarchical modelling settings, such as fitting smooth curves, modelling spatial variation and combining data from multiple sites. /// Les modèles bayésiens hiérarchiques comportent généralement une ou des composantes de variance que l'on doit doter de lois a priori. Le choix de ces lois est délicat car la variation est un aspect des données difficile à cerner. De toutes les lois a priori "par défaut," une loi conjuguée inverse-gamma conditionnelle est la plus souvent employée, malgré ses inconvénients. Les auteurs proposent des lois a priori "conservatrices" pour les composantes de la variance qui privilégient les petites valeurs. Elles conviennent bien aux situations où le chercheur s'interroge sur la présence réelle de variabilité dans les paramètres de deuxième degré (effets aléatoires) et qu'il veut éviter d'imposer une structure artificielle. Les lois a priori suggérées s'adaptent à diverses situations propices à la modélisation hiérarchique, notamment l'ajustement de courbes lisses et la modélisation de variation spatiale ou de données issues de nombreux sites.},

	abstract = {One of the most important differences between Bayesian and traditional techniques is that the former combines information available beforehand—captured in the prior distribution and reflecting the subjective state of belief before an experiment is carried out—and what the data teach us, as expressed in the likelihood function. Bayesian inference is based on the combination of prior and current information which is reflected in the posterior distribution. The fast growing implementation of Bayesian analysis techniques can be attributed to the development of fast computers and the availability of easy to use software. It has long been established that the specification of prior distributions should receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately, flat distributions are often (inappropriately) used in an automatic fashion in a wide range of types of models. We reiterate that the specification of the prior distribution should be done with great care and support this through three examples. Even in the absence of strong prior information, prior specification should be done at the appropriate scale of biological interest. This often requires incorporation of (weak) prior information based on common biological sense. Very weak and uninformative priors at one scale of the model may result in relatively strong priors at other levels affecting the posterior distribution. We present three different examples intuïvely illustrating this phenomenon indicating that this bias can be substantial (especially in small samples) and is widely present. We argue that complete ignorance or absence of prior information may not exist. Because the central theme of the Bayesian paradigm is to combine prior information with current data, authors should be encouraged to publish their raw data such that every scientist is able to perform an analysis incorporating his/her own (subjective) prior distributions.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of species occurrence and the processes underlying these patterns is fundamental to the study of ecology. One of the more commonly used approaches to investigate species occurrence patterns is occupancy modeling, which can account for imperfect detection of a species during surveys. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Bayesian modeling in ecology, which includes fitting Bayesian occupancy models. The Bayesian framework is appealing to ecologists for many reasons, including the ability to incorporate prior information through the specification of prior distributions on parameters. While ecologists almost exclusively intend to choose priors so that they are “uninformative” or “vague”, such priors can easily be unintentionally highly informative. Here we report on how the specification of a “vague” normally distributed (i.e., Gaussian) prior on coefficients in Bayesian occupancy models can unintentionally influence parameter estimation. Using both simulated data and empirical examples, we illustrate how this issue likely compromises inference about species-habitat relationships. While the extent to which these informative priors influence inference depends on the data set, researchers fitting Bayesian occupancy models should conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure intended inference, or employ less commonly used priors that are less informative (e.g., logistic or t prior distributions). We provide suggestions for addressing this issue in occupancy studies, and an online tool for exploring this issue under different contexts.},

We use random effects linear growth model for illustration and consider multivariate distributions to model the variance components jointly including the recently developed generalized multivariate log gamma (G-MVLG) distribution. We discuss these variance priors as well as the independent variance priors exercised in the literature in different aspects including noninformativeness and propriety of the associated posterior density. We show through an extensive simulation experiment that modeling the variance components of different stages multivariately results in better estimation properties for the response and random effect model parameters compared to independent modeling. We scrutinize the sensitivity of response model coefficient estimates to the parameters of considered noninformative variance priors and find that their full conditional expectations are insensitive to noninformative G-MVLG prior parameters. We apply independent and joint models for analysis of a real dataset and find that multivariate priors for variance components lead to better fitted hierarchical model than the univariate variance priors.},

Stan is an expressive probabilistic programing language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. The resulting code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent and flexible. In this tutorial, we demonstrate with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental model in Stan.

	abstract = {Highlights • Bayesian methods are widely used for data-poor stock assessment models. • Four case-studies and a simulation experiment show that Bayesian data-poor assessments can be highly sensitive to unjustified decisions about priors. • Specifically, the arbitrary upper bound on a uniform prior on log-maximum recruitment determines results in 3 of 4 case studies. • Potential solutions involve placing informative priors on other parameters or quantities. • Reviewers should avoid prescribing Bayesian methods for data-poor models, for cases when these four solutions are inappropriate. Abstract A Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in fisheries stock assessment is often preferred over maximum likelihood estimates, and fisheries management guidelines also sometimes specify that one or the other paradigm be used. However, important issues remain unresolved for the Bayesian approach to stock assessment despite over 25 years of research, development, and application. Here, we explore the consequence of a common practice in Bayesian assessment models: assigning a uniform prior to the logarithm of the parameter representing population scale (log-carrying capacity for biomass-dynamics models, or log-unfished recruits for age-structured models). First, we explain why the value chosen for the upper bound of this prior will affect parameter estimates and fisheries management advice given two properties that are met for many data-poor stock assessment models. Next, we use three case studies and a simulation experiment to show a substantial impact of this decision for data-limited assessments off the US West Coast. We end by discussing four methods for generating an informative prior on the population scale parameter, but conclude that these will not be suitable for many assessments. In these cases, we advocate that maximum likelihood estimation is a simple way to avoid the use of Bayesian priors that are excessively informative.},

This is particularly important when there are random effects that are hard to identify based on observed data. The challenge lies in understanding and controlling the joint influence of the priors for the variance parameters, and makemyprior is an R package that guides the formulation of joint prior distributions for variance parameters. A joint prior distribution is constructed based on a hierarchical decomposition of the total variance in the model along a tree, and takes the entire model structure into account. Users input their prior beliefs or express ignorance at each level of the tree. Prior beliefs can be general ideas about reasonable ranges of variance values and need not be detailed expert knowledge. The constructed priors lead to robust inference and guarantee proper posteriors. A graphical user interface facilitates construction and assessment of different choices of priors through visualization of the tree and joint prior. The package aims to expand the toolbox of applied researchers and make priors an active component in their Bayesian workflow.},

These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions.

Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

	abstract = {Statistical modeling is generally meant to describe patterns in data in service of the broader scientific goal of developing theories to explain those patterns. Statistical models support meaningful inferences when models are built so as to align parameters of the model with potential causal mechanisms and how they manifest in data. When statistical models are instead based on assumptions chosen by default, Attempts to draw inferences can be uninformative or even paradoxical—in essence, the tail is trying to wag the dog.These issues are illustrated by van Doorn et al. (in press) in the context of using BayesFactors to identify effects and interactions in linear mixed models. We show that the problems identified in their applications can be circumvented by using priors over inherently meaningful units instead of default priors on standardized scales. This case study illustrates how researchers must directly engage with a number of substantive issues in order to support meaningful inferences, of which we highlight two: The first is the problem of coordination, which requires a researcher to specify how the theoretical constructs postulated by a model are functionally related to observable variables. The second is the problem of generalization, which requires a researcher to consider how a model may represent theoretical constructs shared across similar but non-identical situations, along with the fact that model comparison metrics like Bayes Factors do not directly address this form of generalization. For statistical modeling to serve the goals of science, models cannot be based on default assumptions, but should instead be based on an understanding of their coordination function and on how they represent causal mechanisms that may be expected to generalize to other related scenarios.},

	abstract = {Bayesian hierarchical models typically involve specifying prior distributions for one or more variance components. This is rather removed from the observed data, so specification based on expert knowledge can be difficult. While there are suggestions for "default" priors in the literature, often a conditionally conjugate inverse-gamma specification is used, despite documented drawbacks of this choice. The authors suggest "conservative" prior distributions for variance components, which deliberately give more weight to smaller values. These are appropriate for investigators who are skeptical about the presence of variability in the second-stage parameters (random effects) and want to particularly guard against inferring more structure than is really present. The suggested priors readily adapt to various hierarchical modelling settings, such as fitting smooth curves, modelling spatial variation and combining data from multiple sites. /// Les modèles bayésiens hiérarchiques comportent généralement une ou des composantes de variance que l'on doit doter de lois a priori. Le choix de ces lois est délicat car la variation est un aspect des données difficile à cerner. De toutes les lois a priori "par défaut," une loi conjuguée inverse-gamma conditionnelle est la plus souvent employée, malgré ses inconvénients. Les auteurs proposent des lois a priori "conservatrices" pour les composantes de la variance qui privilégient les petites valeurs. Elles conviennent bien aux situations où le chercheur s'interroge sur la présence réelle de variabilité dans les paramètres de deuxième degré (effets aléatoires) et qu'il veut éviter d'imposer une structure artificielle. Les lois a priori suggérées s'adaptent à diverses situations propices à la modélisation hiérarchique, notamment l'ajustement de courbes lisses et la modélisation de variation spatiale ou de données issues de nombreux sites.},

	abstract = {One of the most important differences between Bayesian and traditional techniques is that the former combines information available beforehand—captured in the prior distribution and reflecting the subjective state of belief before an experiment is carried out—and what the data teach us, as expressed in the likelihood function. Bayesian inference is based on the combination of prior and current information which is reflected in the posterior distribution. The fast growing implementation of Bayesian analysis techniques can be attributed to the development of fast computers and the availability of easy to use software. It has long been established that the specification of prior distributions should receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately, flat distributions are often (inappropriately) used in an automatic fashion in a wide range of types of models. We reiterate that the specification of the prior distribution should be done with great care and support this through three examples. Even in the absence of strong prior information, prior specification should be done at the appropriate scale of biological interest. This often requires incorporation of (weak) prior information based on common biological sense. Very weak and uninformative priors at one scale of the model may result in relatively strong priors at other levels affecting the posterior distribution. We present three different examples intuïvely illustrating this phenomenon indicating that this bias can be substantial (especially in small samples) and is widely present. We argue that complete ignorance or absence of prior information may not exist. Because the central theme of the Bayesian paradigm is to combine prior information with current data, authors should be encouraged to publish their raw data such that every scientist is able to perform an analysis incorporating his/her own (subjective) prior distributions.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of species occurrence and the processes underlying these patterns is fundamental to the study of ecology. One of the more commonly used approaches to investigate species occurrence patterns is occupancy modeling, which can account for imperfect detection of a species during surveys. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Bayesian modeling in ecology, which includes fitting Bayesian occupancy models. The Bayesian framework is appealing to ecologists for many reasons, including the ability to incorporate prior information through the specification of prior distributions on parameters. While ecologists almost exclusively intend to choose priors so that they are “uninformative” or “vague”, such priors can easily be unintentionally highly informative. Here we report on how the specification of a “vague” normally distributed (i.e., Gaussian) prior on coefficients in Bayesian occupancy models can unintentionally influence parameter estimation. Using both simulated data and empirical examples, we illustrate how this issue likely compromises inference about species-habitat relationships. While the extent to which these informative priors influence inference depends on the data set, researchers fitting Bayesian occupancy models should conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure intended inference, or employ less commonly used priors that are less informative (e.g., logistic or t prior distributions). We provide suggestions for addressing this issue in occupancy studies, and an online tool for exploring this issue under different contexts.},

We use random effects linear growth model for illustration and consider multivariate distributions to model the variance components jointly including the recently developed generalized multivariate log gamma (G-MVLG) distribution. We discuss these variance priors as well as the independent variance priors exercised in the literature in different aspects including noninformativeness and propriety of the associated posterior density. We show through an extensive simulation experiment that modeling the variance components of different stages multivariately results in better estimation properties for the response and random effect model parameters compared to independent modeling. We scrutinize the sensitivity of response model coefficient estimates to the parameters of considered noninformative variance priors and find that their full conditional expectations are insensitive to noninformative G-MVLG prior parameters. We apply independent and joint models for analysis of a real dataset and find that multivariate priors for variance components lead to better fitted hierarchical model than the univariate variance priors.},

Stan is an expressive probabilistic programing language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. The resulting code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent and flexible. In this tutorial, we demonstrate with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental model in Stan.

	abstract = {Highlights • Bayesian methods are widely used for data-poor stock assessment models. • Four case-studies and a simulation experiment show that Bayesian data-poor assessments can be highly sensitive to unjustified decisions about priors. • Specifically, the arbitrary upper bound on a uniform prior on log-maximum recruitment determines results in 3 of 4 case studies. • Potential solutions involve placing informative priors on other parameters or quantities. • Reviewers should avoid prescribing Bayesian methods for data-poor models, for cases when these four solutions are inappropriate. Abstract A Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in fisheries stock assessment is often preferred over maximum likelihood estimates, and fisheries management guidelines also sometimes specify that one or the other paradigm be used. However, important issues remain unresolved for the Bayesian approach to stock assessment despite over 25 years of research, development, and application. Here, we explore the consequence of a common practice in Bayesian assessment models: assigning a uniform prior to the logarithm of the parameter representing population scale (log-carrying capacity for biomass-dynamics models, or log-unfished recruits for age-structured models). First, we explain why the value chosen for the upper bound of this prior will affect parameter estimates and fisheries management advice given two properties that are met for many data-poor stock assessment models. Next, we use three case studies and a simulation experiment to show a substantial impact of this decision for data-limited assessments off the US West Coast. We end by discussing four methods for generating an informative prior on the population scale parameter, but conclude that these will not be suitable for many assessments. In these cases, we advocate that maximum likelihood estimation is a simple way to avoid the use of Bayesian priors that are excessively informative.},

This is particularly important when there are random effects that are hard to identify based on observed data. The challenge lies in understanding and controlling the joint influence of the priors for the variance parameters, and makemyprior is an R package that guides the formulation of joint prior distributions for variance parameters. A joint prior distribution is constructed based on a hierarchical decomposition of the total variance in the model along a tree, and takes the entire model structure into account. Users input their prior beliefs or express ignorance at each level of the tree. Prior beliefs can be general ideas about reasonable ranges of variance values and need not be detailed expert knowledge. The constructed priors lead to robust inference and guarantee proper posteriors. A graphical user interface facilitates construction and assessment of different choices of priors through visualization of the tree and joint prior. The package aims to expand the toolbox of applied researchers and make priors an active component in their Bayesian workflow.},

These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions.

Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

	abstract = {Statistical modeling is generally meant to describe patterns in data in service of the broader scientific goal of developing theories to explain those patterns. Statistical models support meaningful inferences when models are built so as to align parameters of the model with potential causal mechanisms and how they manifest in data. When statistical models are instead based on assumptions chosen by default, Attempts to draw inferences can be uninformative or even paradoxical—in essence, the tail is trying to wag the dog.These issues are illustrated by van Doorn et al. (in press) in the context of using BayesFactors to identify effects and interactions in linear mixed models. We show that the problems identified in their applications can be circumvented by using priors over inherently meaningful units instead of default priors on standardized scales. This case study illustrates how researchers must directly engage with a number of substantive issues in order to support meaningful inferences, of which we highlight two: The first is the problem of coordination, which requires a researcher to specify how the theoretical constructs postulated by a model are functionally related to observable variables. The second is the problem of generalization, which requires a researcher to consider how a model may represent theoretical constructs shared across similar but non-identical situations, along with the fact that model comparison metrics like Bayes Factors do not directly address this form of generalization. For statistical modeling to serve the goals of science, models cannot be based on default assumptions, but should instead be based on an understanding of their coordination function and on how they represent causal mechanisms that may be expected to generalize to other related scenarios.},
